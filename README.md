# ECG Afib Detector GUI

A Python-based GUI application to visualize ECG signals and detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) using threshold-based RR interval analysis.

## Features
- Tkinter GUI with ECG waveform viewer
- RR interval analysis (RMSSD, PNN50, CVRR)
- Basic QRS detection
- Unit testing with HTMLTestRunner
- Ready for AI model expansion

## Quick Start
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Report_AfibDetect.py
```

## Future
Machine Learning version planned in `ml_model.py`
